        <h3>Soy Broth</h3>
            <li>3 l Water</li>
            <li>900 g chicken bones</li>
            <li>450 g boneless pork shoulder or loin</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 piece ginger, sliced</li>
            <li>3 green onions, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>250 ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>60 ml sake</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>

        <h3>Chashu Sauce</h3>
            <li>160 ml water</li>
            <li>80 ml sake</li>
            <li>80 ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, then place them in a large pot with the water, pork, garlic, ginger, and green onions.</li>
            <li>Bring to the boil, removing the dirt that comes to the surface. Lower the heat and simmer with the pot covered for around two hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the pork, then strain off the broth, getting rid of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, sake, and mirin, then leave to simmer with the pot covered until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients for the chashu sauce in a large pan. Add the pork, then bring to the boil over a medium heat. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly open so the steam can escape, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for around 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time until just a little bit of liquid is left.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, stay with the pan, and watch the liquid simmer until bubbles start to appear.</li>
            <li>Turn the pork to cover it completely with the sauce, then remove from the pan and slice thinly.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging. Divide the broth into six bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
